# Creating PBR materials
## Overview
Compared to the standard Source workflow, the PBR workflow is much more complicated. While most Source textures can be created with a simple image editing program like GIMP, PBR textures need many more textures, some of which cannot be created with a simple paintbrush or pattern tool (well, they can, but it's not recommended). These textures need specialized programs to create them, of which there are a couple of options. This page will not cover the creation of these textures, as many tutorials already exist on this topic. This page will however go over the creation of MRAO textures and the creation of the material file.
