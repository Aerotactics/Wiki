# Creating PBR textures
When compared to the standard Source workflow, PBR is a lot more complicated. While most Source textures can be created with a simple image editing program like GIMP, PBR textures need many more textures, some of which cannot be created with a simple paintbrush or pattern tool (well, they can, but it's not recommended). Most need specialized programs, which are often paid or locked behind subscriptions.
